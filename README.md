# Projeto Sistemas Distribuidos e Mobile

Nome do Aplicativo ‚û° :construction:  Em breve :construction:

This project was developed with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.2 and [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) for the front-end and [NojeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the back-end.

The project consists on a Web App for search information about movies and games. Our front-end allows the user to realize a search by name and the back-end calls one or both of the two external APIs ([TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and [IGDB](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about)) for fecth the requested data. Then our application shows the data fetched on a beautiful way.

## Development front-end server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development back-end server

Run `npm run dev:server` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
